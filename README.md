# Robustness and Failure Mode Analysis of Large Language Models

## Objective

This project investigates the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on how they respond to adversarial, ambiguous, and biased prompts. The aim is to develop a reproducible benchmarking pipeline, analyze failure cases, and propose mitigation strategies.

## Steps Overview

1. Literature Review and Problem Definition
2. Dataset Creation (adversarial, ambiguous, bias prompts)
3. Automated Benchmarking Pipeline to query LLMs
4. Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of outputs
5. Data Visualization and Reporting
6. Propose and test improvements
7. Open-source publication

## Motivation

Understanding failure modes of language models is crucial for creating safe, reliable, and unbiased AI applications. This project aligns with OpenAI’s mission of safe and robust AI.
